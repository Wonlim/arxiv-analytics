            |  is an open source JavaScript engine for mathematics in web browsers. We use the 
            code TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML
            |  configuration, which allows math to be specified in

            |  notation, with the AMSmath and AMSsymbols packages included. For Firefox, the NativeMML output processor is used by default, which renders mathematics in native MathML and thus is much faster than using the HTML-CSS output. You can employ the MathJax contextual menu to select the other renderer as you like.
          p To use the shorthands 
            code \(...\)
            |  and 
            code \[...\]
            |  as delimiters for mathematics in LaTeX, you should esacpe the backslash as 
            code \\
            | . So, it is better to use 
            code $...$
            |  and 
            code $$...$$
            |  or the corresponding environments defined by 
            code \begin{}...\end{}
            |  instead. Please have a look at the MathJax 
            a(href='http://www.mathjax.org/demos/' rel='external' target='_blank') demos
            |  to get some practical examples. We also have some tips for typesetting math in LaTeX using MathJax:
          ul
            li Don't use too many small spaces like 
              code \;
              |  and 
              code \:
              |  for fine tuning. In most cases, they are abused.
            li Don't waste space if two short expressions can be put on the same line. You should use 
              code \quad
              |  to seperate them.
            li Don’t use 
              code \frac
              |  in-line. Use that only if you are setting aside the equation.
            li To get a dollar sign in text, you can use 
              code \\$
              |  or something like 
              code &lt;span&gt;\$&lt;/span&gt;
              |  to isolate it.
            li You can use 
              code \slashed
              |  to produce the Feynman slashed-character notation.
            li Always put spaces around symbols for better readability and try your best to arrange math in a presentable way.
